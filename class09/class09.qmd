In today's class we will examine some data about andy from the 538 website.

## Import Data
```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.txt"
```

## Data Exploration
```{r}
candy <- read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

There are `r nrow(candy)` in this dataset

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

There are `r sum(candy$fruity)` fruity candy types.
```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

# My favorite candy vs yours
```{r}
candy["Snickers",]$winpercent
```
```{r}
candy["Welch's Fruit Snacks",]$winpercent
```
```{r}
candy["Warheads",]$winpercent
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```
> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The winpercent variable is on a different scale.
```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

0 represents no chocolate in the candy and 1 represents chocolate being in the candy.
```{r}
candy$chocolate
```

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins=7)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, it is slightly skewed to the left.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

Below
```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

- first find all chocolate candy
- find their winpercent values
- calculate the mean

```{r}
chocolate.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
chocolate.win <- candy[chocolate.inds,]$winpercent
mean(chocolate.win)
```

- then do the same for fruity candy and compare with the mean for chocolate candy

```{r}
fruity.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruity.win <- candy[fruity.inds,]$winpercent
mean(fruity.win)
```
Chocolate is ranked higher than fruity candy.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(chocolate.win, fruity.win)
```
Yes

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
x <- c(5, 6, 4)
sort(x)
```

```{r}
x[order(x)]
```
The order function returns the indices that make the input sorted.

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```


> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[inds,], 5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggsave("mybarplot.png", height=10)
```

![Exported image that is a bit bigger so I can read it](mybarplot.png)


Add my cutom colors to my barplot

```{r}
my_cols=rep("gray", nrow(candy))
my_cols[candy$fruity == 1] <- "pink"
my_cols
```

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)
```

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "red"
```

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

Plot of winpercent vs pricepercent

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col= my_cols) +
  geom_text(col=my_cols)
```

There are just too many labels in this above plot to be readable. We can use the `ggrepel` package to do a better job og placing lavels so they minimize text overlap.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col= my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

## 5 Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```


```{r}
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

chocolate and fruity

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

chocolate and bar; chocolate and winpercent

## 6. Principal Component Analysis

We will perform a PCA of the candy. Key-question: do we need to scale the data before PCA?

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale= TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=my_cols, pch= 16)
```

Make a ggplot version of this figure:

```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
head(my_data)
```


```{r}
ggplot(my_data) + 
  aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=rownames(my_data)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols)
```

Make this a bit nicer

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

```{r}
p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```


```{r}
#| eval: false

library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)
```

How do the original variables contribute to our PCS? For this we look at the loadings component of our results object i.e. the `pca$rotation` object.

```{r}
head(pca$rotation[,1])
```

Make a barplot with ggplot and order the bars by their value. Recall that you need a data.frame as input for ggplot

```{r}
res <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(res) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(row.names(res), PC1)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

fruity, pluribus, and hard are all picked up in the positive direction and these do make sense based on the correlation structure in the dataset. If you are a fruity candy you will tend to be hard and come in a packet with multiple candys in it (pluribus).
