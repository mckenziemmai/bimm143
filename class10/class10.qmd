## What is in the PDB database

The main repository of biomolecular structure info is the PDB < www.rcsb.org >.

Let's see what this database contains:

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
as.numeric(stats$X.ray)
```
We got to get rid of the commas. Can you find a function to get rid of the commas?

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
```

I am going to turn this into a function and then use `apply()` to work on the entire table of data

```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
}

sumcomma(stats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
n.total <- sumcomma(stats$Total)
n.total
```

```{r}
sumcomma(stats$EM)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)/ sumcomma(stats$Total)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

In UniProt there are 248,805,733 entries which compared to PDB protein entries (186, 898) means there are only ~7% of known sequences
248,805,733 - 186,898

```{r}
186898/248805733 * 100
```

## Visualizing the HIV-1 protein strucutre


Mol* ("mol-star") viewer is now everywhere. The homepage is here: https://molstar.org/viewer

I want to insert my image from Mol* here

## Working with bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```


```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```


```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```


```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```


## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can do a bioinformatics prediction of functional motions (i.e. flexibility/dynamics):

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```


```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

# Comparative Analysis of Protein Structures

Here we will work through a complete pipeline of analysis for a given protein family starting from one single database ID for a member of this family all the way to a deeper understanding of strucutre, dynamics, and function.


```{r}
library(bio3d)
```


```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"

aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```


```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```


```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Align related PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

Print out the alignment!
```{r}
pdbs
```


```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
